Cheat Sheet - Git Commands Used in This Section

In this section, you installed and configured Git on your machine. To configure Git, you learned about different commands.
You used the following Git commands

Show the version of your Git installation:

git -v

Show the configurations:

git config -l

Configure your username and email:

git config --global user.name "uruc-developer@hpmini"

git config --global user.email "urucs.dev@outlook.de"

The username and email is used by Git for every commit that you will create. Without this configuration, you are not able to commit to a repository.

To show the origin of the configurations, you learned about the --show-origin parameter. It shows you in which file a configuration is located:

git config -l --show-origin

This command above allows you to find the .gitconfig file that is in your user directory. That .gitconfig file contains now the username and the email that you configured.

Now, Git is set up and configured. This means you're ready for some work! :-)

In the next section, you will learn how to work with local repositories. But before that, let's test your knowledge with some learning questions.
